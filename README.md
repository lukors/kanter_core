# kanter_core
This is a library for node based image editing created for use in my program [Kanter](https://github.com/lukors/kanter).

## Current state
It is in working condition and it should be easy to see how it works by looking at the tests in `tests/integration_tests.rs`.

However it is not meant to be used yet, I'm not even updating the version number, it's more like a personal project currently, so there might still be big changes.

## Plans
Currently I'm working on a GUI for this library over in [Kanter](https://github.com/lukors/kanter), which is likely to require some changes in this library.

Once that is working I'm going to think about what the next steps should be.
